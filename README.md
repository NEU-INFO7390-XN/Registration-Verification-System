## Setup (local development)

1. Clone the repo and cd into it.

2. Quick run with `uv` (fast, minimal) (Ignore this step if you choose run step 3)

If you prefer a very short workflow and already have the `uv` runner available on your machine, you can use it to sync environment and run the app quickly:

```bash
# sync dependencies / environment (if your uv setup supports it)
uv sync
```

Note: `uv` is optional — if you don't have it or prefer a more explicit setup, use one of the normal workflows below.

3. Standard workflows (recommended) (Ignore this step if you choose run step 2)

- Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```

- Install dependencies.

If you use Poetry (project has `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Or with pip (if you maintain a `requirements.txt`) you can do:

```bash
# optional: create requirements.txt from poetry if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Copy and fill the environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set real secrets (do NOT commit .env)
```

The code loads `.env` from the repository root using python-dotenv. The `Config` class in `src/app/config/config.py` exposes those env values as attributes.

## Running the app

Run directly with Python (recommended during development):

```bash
python src/main.py
```

If you use the `uv` runner you previously used:

```bash
uv run python src/main.py
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:5050 (or the host/port from your `.env`) to see the landing endpoint.

## Configuration

- Edit `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) and fill required values: MongoDB creds (if used), AWS/S3 keys (if used), admin email.
- `src/app/config/config.py` provides a `Config` class that reads env vars and offers `Config.validate_required()` to fail fast on missing required keys.


Additional configuration variables
- `JOTFORM_API_KEY` - (optional) API key used when fetching image URLs hosted by JotForm. When present the utility will append it as `?apiKey=...` to JotForm URLs.


## Data storage (Google Sheets or CSV)

- Default local development originally used a CSV-backed datastore (`data/registration_data.csv`) managed by `app.services.database`. You can continue using a local CSV, however this project also supports using Google Sheets as the primary backing store for local development and lightweight deployments.

- Google Sheets is useful when you want a simple, shareable spreadsheet UI instead of opening the CSV file directly. When enabled the app will read/write rows to a Google Sheet and mirror many CSV behaviors (case-insensitive headers, empty-cell matching).

How to choose:

- CSV (local): keep using `data/registration_data.csv` — no external services required. Ensure `data/` exists.
- Google Sheets: recommended for collaborative local testing and when you prefer a sheet UI. The instructions below show how to enable Sheets and configure credentials.
- Change root __init__.py file ```app.db``` is equal to ```init_csv()``` or ```init_google_sheet()```.
## Google Sheets setup (GCP) — replace local CSV with a Sheet

Follow these steps to enable Google Sheets for local development and to let the app read/write registration rows directly to a sheet.

1) Create a Google Cloud project (or use an existing one)
	- Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create/select a project.

2) Enable APIs
	- Enable the "Google Sheets API" (and optionally the "Google Drive API" if you plan to manage file permissions programmatically).

3) Create a service account
	- IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create Service Account
	- Give it a descriptive name (e.g. "reg-verif-sheets-sa").

4) Create and download a JSON key
	- In the service account page, create a new key (JSON) and download it.
	- IMPORTANT: keep this file private. DO NOT commit it to git.

5) Place the key into the repository (for local development only)
	- Put the downloaded JSON into the project at `src/data/key/credentials.json` (or update the path below if you prefer another location).
	- Example (do NOT run this in CI or commit the file):

```bash
# copy credentials locally (example)
mkdir -p src/data/key
cp /path/to/downloaded-key.json src/data/key/credentials.json
```

6) Set environment variables
	- In your `.env` file set the following values:

```text
# Google Sheets
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_WORKSHEET_NAME=your_google_sheet_name_here
```

* Note:
	If your Google Sheet URL looks like this:

	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/**12345-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWzYx**/edit#gid=0

	The Google Sheet ID is: 12345-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWzYx

7) Share the spreadsheet with the service account
	- Open your Google Sheet in the browser.
	- Click "Share" and add the `client_email` value from your `credentials.json` (it looks like `your-sa-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) as an Editor. This grants the service account permission to read/write the sheet.

8) Confirm scopes
	- The app requests at least the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope. If you enabled Drive API, include `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` when creating credentials or in your code's scope list.

9) Run the app
	- With credentials present and the sheet shared, start the app normally. The app's initialization will load the credentials (from `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) and open the sheet by `SHEET_ID`.

Security notes
	- Never commit service account keys to git. Add `src/data/key/credentials.json` to `.gitignore`.
	- Rotate/delete keys immediately if they are accidentally committed or leaked.
	- For CI or production, use secret managers (GitHub Actions secrets, GCP Secret Manager, etc.) or mount the key at runtime rather than storing it in repository source.

## Background jobs

The system uses Google Script to call payment_service and reminder_service daily.

	}
	```

## Image utilities & OCR

The helpers in `src/app/utils/image_utils.py` are small, composable building blocks used in sequence depending on your input source (URL or local file). They handle HTML pages that embed images, convert image bytes to OpenCV arrays, and provide both local (Tesseract) and remote (Ninja OCR) OCR paths.

Typical workflows

- URL → remote OCR
  1. Call `get_image(source='URL', imgURL=...)` downloads image bytes and use the module's `bytes_to_cv2` helper to convert bytes to an OpenCV ndarray. If the URL returns HTML, the helper extracts the first `<img>` and follows it. If `JOTFORM_API_KEY` is set it will be appended to JotForm-hosted URLs.
  2. Preprocess/crop with `image_preprocess` to do edge detection and grayscale.
  3. Call `ninja_image_to_text(image_or_bytes)` to send the image to the remote OCR endpoint (requires `NINJA_API_KEY`).

- URL → local OCR (Tesseract)
  1. Load with `get_image(source='PATH', imgPath=...)`.
  2. Preprocess/crop with `image_preprocess` to do edge detection and grayscale.
  3. Call `local_image_to_text(image_array)` which uses `pytesseract` for OCR.

Notes
- `ninja_image_to_text` accepts a NumPy ndarray, raw bytes, or a PIL Image — it encodes to JPEG before sending to the remote API. Ensure `NINJA_API_KEY` is set in `.env` when using the remote service.

Dependencies
- These helpers use the following third-party packages; ensure they are installed in your environment (they are listed in `pyproject.toml`):
	- `requests` — HTTP requests
	- `beautifulsoup4` (`bs4`) — HTML parsing
	- `pillow` (`PIL`) — image decoding/fallback
	- `numpy` — array / ndarray handling
	- `opencv-python` (imported as `cv2`) — image processing and computer vision
	- `pytesseract` — Python wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine
	- `gspread` - Google Sheet

Additional system dependency:
- Tesseract OCR binary (required by `pytesseract`). Install on macOS with `brew install tesseract` or on Debian/Ubuntu with `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`.

## Development tips & common troubleshooting

- Python version: Use 3.9.
- Missing `data` directory: create it or ensure `init_csv` runs (it attempts to create the parent path if needed).
- Ensure `.env` is present in the project root when running locally. Use `.env.example` as a template.

## 🚧 Future Edge Cases for Development

The following issues represent limitations in the current system logic, primarily around course selection, date handling, and payment matching. Addressing these will significantly improve system robustness.

### 1. Handling Course Quantity Selection

| Current Limitation | Proposed Future Fix | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jotform allows clients to select a quantity (e.g., 2 spots)** for a single course via its product list, but the current webhook/database logic assumes **one registration record = one course.** The system cannot correctly track or process submissions for multiple spots/quantities. | **Implement Quantity Splitting Logic.** If the Jotform submission includes a quantity greater than one, the webhook processor must **automatically create and insert separate, distinct registration records** in the database (one for each spot purchased). The total payment amount must be correctly distributed or verified against the total quantity. | **High** |

---

### 2. Standardizing Course Name and Date for Matching

| Current Limitation | Proposed Future Fix | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Course dates/options are treated separately** from the core course name in Jotform/Zeffy. The course date is not consistently included as a permanent part of the **Course Name** used for Zeffy payment matching, leading to ambiguous matching (e.g., distinguishing between "SFA - Nov 9" and "SFA - Dec 1"). | **Enforce Standardized Course Keys.** Modify the Jotform field and the regex logic to ensure the **Course Name** extracted **always includes the date or specific option** (e.g., `Standard First Aid (Nov 9)`). This composite key must be the exact value used for payment matching in the Zeffy notification and stored in the database. | **High** |

---

### 3. Mismatched Dates Between Registration and Payment

| Current Limitation | Proposed Future Fix | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| If a client registers for a course date via **Jotform (Date A)** but then manually selects a different date/product via **Zeffy (Date B)**, the final database record currently reflects **Date A** (the Jotform submission), creating a booking error. | **Payment-Driven Date Correction.** Implement logic to compare the registered course/date (from Jotform) with the final course/date identifier in the **Zeffy payment notification**. If a discrepancy exists, the system should **override the Jotform date** and update the database record to reflect the date selected during the **Zeffy payment process (Date B)**, as this confirms the client's final purchase intention. | **Medium** |

---

### 4. Upload image orientation & format

| Current Limitation | Proposed Future Fix | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Uploaded PR card images may be portrait/rotated or submitted as PDFs, causing OCR and heuristic failures. | Enforce image-only uploads (reject PDFs) and require the card to be uploaded in landscape orientation with the Canadian flag / "Government of Canada" text positioned at the top. Add validation in the upload pipeline to: (1) reject non-image MIME types (e.g., application/pdf), (2) check image orientation (width >= height) and attempt auto-rotation using EXIF when possible, and (3) return a clear client-facing error instructing the user to upload a JPG/PNG image of the PR card in landscape orientation with the flag at the top if validation fails. | **High** |

---

### 5. PR Confirmation Letter (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

| Current Limitation | Proposed Future Fix | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| The system does not yet process PR Confirmation Letters because business rules are unclear (for example: where/how the PR Card Number appears on the confirmation letter). | Defer implementation until business rules are clarified. When rules are provided, implement extraction heuristics (OCR + regex / field anchors) for the confirmation letter and map extracted fields to the registration record. Consider a staged approach: (1) collect sample confirmation-letter images from stakeholders, (2) derive reliable anchors or templates for locating the PR Card Number, (3) build and test OCR + post-processing rules, and (4) add automated validation and manual-review fallback. | Medium |
